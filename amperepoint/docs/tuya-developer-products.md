## Local profile strategy

Keep HACS generic at the Q Series family level. Keep `tuya-local` profiles product/generation-specific enough to capture DP differences.

Current profile coverage:

| Product ID | Profile |
| --- | --- |
| `bktb3jskdic1ar2t` | `profiles/tuya_local/amperepoint_q_series_evcharger.yaml` |
| `fdfjiphjxtc9qyhd` | `profiles/tuya_local/amperepoint_ve_evcharger.yaml` |
| `cu111poj2mtikvls` | `profiles/tuya_local/amperepoint_q22_ota_evcharger.yaml`, candidate until physical test |
| `gbmxngploofmhbjc` | `profiles/tuya_local/amperepoint_prime_22kw_evcharger.yaml`, read-only telemetry profile |

Other product IDs should be added to a profile only after a function-definition screenshot/export or physical local DP dump confirms the layout.

## Physical LAN-only product maps

| Product name | Product ID | Evidence | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Wallbox Prime 22kW` | `gbmxngploofmhbjc` | Direct Tuya LAN 3.5 reads | The DP layout differs from the documented Q-series products. The initial cloud integration was light-like and the inverter profile selected by `tuya-local` was incompatible. |

```

## Product function maps

Captured detailed function maps:

```text
docs/product-fdfjiphjxtc9qyhd-ev-charger-ve.md
docs/product-cu111poj2mtikvls-q22-ota.md
```

The visible DP layout for `EV Charger_VE` and `Q22 OTA` is very similar. Physical HA testing still matters because the Q37/VE test unit did not provide trustworthy DP6/DP7/DP8 phase values even though the product definition lists them.
